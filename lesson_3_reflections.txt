When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* When I work with repository using different machines

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

*cause I if really need to pull then I will pull changes, but if I not then I don`t want to make any changes with my local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks are used in Github, Clone is used locally and between GitHub and local machine, branch - local fork.
